            <div class="card-content">
                <p>This stream investigates the correlation between peer
 relationships and academic engagement among grade 10 students at APEC 
Schools.  The study examines various aspects of peer interactions, 
including positive ones like collaborative learning and negative impacts
 such as peer pressure and bullying. Our stream provides insights into 
fostering positive peer relationships, benefiting both students and 
adults in various settings by offering strategies for building and 
maintaining healthy connections. And we also learned about effective 
marketing strategies; how you communicate with the students, and also 
promoting our live stream.

            <div class="card-content">
              <p> Viewer engagement - We believe that this is one of our
 group’s strengths as our group can communicate not only through our 
members but also our viewers making them feel more comfortable and 
welcomed to our stream. The more viewers feel comfortable with us, the 
more comfortable the environment of the stream becomes which can cause 
positive growths. Not only could our stream give opportunity for our 
viewers to learn and grow along with us with our topics, they can also 
help us to learn and grow through questions. 

                </p><p>Adaptation - This is one of our group’s strengths
 as our group was met with several obstacles. So we were able to 
formulate alternatives while still maintaining a positive attitude for 
the stream. Keeping the viewers engaged rather than them leaving our 
stream.

            <div class="card-content">
                <p>Content collabs and a consistent streaming schedule 
allows for audience engagement and the potential for new viewers. 
Engaging with an audience and building a community creates that more 
personal connection that makes people want to come back for more. The 
more one streams, the more opportunity there is to view content, and 
thus more sets of eyes can be on the channel. Professionalism is created
 by professional equipment; clean sound and visuals create digestible, 
refined experiences. Recognition and entertainment comes from a visible 
branding experience compounded by collaborations.</p>

            <div class="card-header">Marketing and Engagement</div>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p>Around a week before the planned stream date, we 
created a poster and placed it outside the door of 10-2. This was our 
physical poster for advertising our stream and we focused more of our 
marketing efforts on social media. One day before the stream several of 
our group members posted our poster on social media, advertising it to 
friends and family. Finally, on the day of the stream, we sent an email 
announcing to all grade levels in V. Luna that our live stream was up 
and running.

During our live stream, we had some decent viewer engagement. According 
to our Twitch analytics, we had 3 chat message spikes of activity 
throughout the entire stream. We also gained 7 new followers over the 
whole stream, which means that some viewers are ready to return to our 
stream whenever we stream again. Overall, we had decent success with 
marketing and engagement, as we had most of our viewers and followers 
come from our direct advertising according to the statistics.

            <div class="card-header">Performance Analysis</div>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p>Over the course of our entire stream, there was a 
consistent average of around 10 viewers. It’s somewhere in the middle 
where I consider to be high or low for viewership. I consider single 
digits like 5 viewers to be “low viewership”, whereas I consider double 
digits like 15+ viewers to be “high viewership”. And we had a total of 
59 unique viewers that interacted with our livestream.

According to our Twitch channel’s overview, we had a peak viewership of 
19 viewers, which roughly stayed consistent during the whole time. 
Unfortunately due to connection problems that popped up in the middle of
 streaming, there was a slight decrease in live viewers according to our
 graph. Interestingly, we had a spike in average viewers right before we
 lost connection, and had another spike in average viewers right after 
our stream came back online. I believe that as a whole, we had pretty 
decent viewership count, considering we had a lackluster promotion 
strategy that resulted in viewers having little time to prepare time to 
watch our premiere livestream.
